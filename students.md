# Resources for Students

A place for me to put whatever I think is useful to share with students.

## Useful Tools

Below is a list of tools that might help you with your Honours Project / Bachelor Thesis / Master Thesis.

### Miscellaneous

- **[reptyr](https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr)** allows you to attach a process to another terminal. Useful for moving processes when you forgot to start them in [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) or [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/).

### TODO:

- **Top UNIX utilities**
- **Git**
- **Gradle**
- **Ansible**
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Terraform**
