How to change your main display on MacOS? Going to `Settings > Display > Arrangement` seems like a reasonable place to start.

But now what?
The menu shows both displays as blue rectangles, with their size corresponding to their pixel resolution.
Unfortunately, there seems to be no indication of what the main display is, or how to change it.

But there is!
The 3-pixel-wide white rectangle indicates that the top display is the main display.
In contrast to the menu text "To relocate the menu bar, drag it to a different display,"
the rectangle seems unrelated to the menu bar,
because the menu bar is visible on both screens.

Instead of moving the menu bar from one screen to another,
dragging and dropping the white bar to another display makes that display the _main_ display.
