A checklist for talks and presentations, for the benefit of myself and students I work with.

- Slides have slide numbers
- All text (including text in plots) is readable (font size ≥ 28)
- Number of slides ∈ [½×minutes, minutes]
- Presentation starts with WHY: societal context and problem statement
- If you present research questions
  - The research questions are addressed throughout the presentation (probably through the contributions).
  - During the presentation, remind the audience when you address a research question.
- Presentation conveys core contributions (e.g., design, experiment results), but skips unnecessary details
- If you present a design
  - Explain the design requirements
  - Explain the design overview
  - Explain detailed parts of the design if necessary
  - Explain how your design addresses the design requirements
- For each result, sufficient time (e.g., 2 minutes) allocated to present the plot/table:
  - Say what the plot shows on a high level (e.g., provides evidence for a claim made in paper)
  - Explain the horizontal axis
  - Explain the vertical axis
  - Explain what the boxes/curves/... in the plot mean
  - Explain what the boxes/curves/... show
  - Explain how this leads to the high-level observation mentioned at the start
- Presentation ends with a Take-Home Message, summarizing the talk and tying results back to problem statement
