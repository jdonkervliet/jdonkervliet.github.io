I entered the world of teaching as a Teaching Assistant for the course Computer Organization while I was doing my Bachelors in Computer Science at the [TU Delft][url-tudelft].

Since then, I've been unable to stop teaching. I continued TA'ing throughout my Bachelors and Masters at the TU, worked as a full-time teacher at the TU for a year after graduating, and then started as both a teacher and PhD student at the VU.

In addition to teaching courses, I also supervise multiple students and student groups for courses and research projects associated with the [@Large group][url-atlarge].
