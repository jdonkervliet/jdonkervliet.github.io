I'm proud to announce our work ''Can My WiFi Handle the Metaverse? A Performance Evaluation Of Meta’s Flagship Virtual Reality Hardware'' has been accepted at [HotCloudPerf 2023](https://hotcloudperf.spec.org/)!

In this work, we design and conduct experiments using the Meta Quest Pro VR headset to determine if modern WiFi networks provide sufficiently good performance to support the much anticipated metaverse,
and obtain surprising results.

 Abstract:

> Extending human societies into virtual space through the construction of a metaverse has been a long-term challenge in both industry
and academia. Achieving this challenge is now closer than ever due
to advances in computer systems, facilitating large-scale online platforms such as Minecraft and Roblox that fulfill an increasing number
of societal needs, and extended reality (XR) hardware, which provides users with state-of-the-art immersive experiences. For a metaverse to succeed, we argue that all involved systems must provide
consistently good performance. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the performance characteristics of extended reality devices.
In this paper, we address this gap and focus on extended- and virtual-reality hardware. We synthesize a user-centered system model that
models common deployments of XR hardware and their trade-offs.
Based on this model, we design and conduct real-world experiments
with Meta’s flagship virtual reality device, the Quest Pro. We highlight two surprising results from our findings which show that (i) under our workload, the battery drains 15% faster when using wireless
offloading compared to local execution, and (ii) the outdated 2.4 GHz
WiFi4 gives surprisingly good performance, with 99% of samples
achieving a frame rate of at least 65 Hz, compared to the 72 Hz
performance target. Our experimental setup and data are available
