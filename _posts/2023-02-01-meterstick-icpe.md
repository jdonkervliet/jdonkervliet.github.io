I'm proud to announce our work ''Meterstick: Benchmarking Performance Variability in Cloud and Self-hosted Minecraft-like Games'' has been accepted at [ICPE 2023](https://icpe2023.spec.org/)!

The work is led by [Jerrit Eickhoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerrit-eickhoff/), who completed this work over the course of his bachelor's honours and bachelor thesis projects at VU Amsterdam. Well done, Jerrit!

Meterstick abstract:

> Due to increasing popularity and strict performance requirements,
online games have become a cloud-based and self-hosted work-load of interest for the performance engineering community. One
of the most popular types of online games is the Minecraft-like
Game (MLG), in which players can terraform the environment. The
most popular MLG, Minecraft, provides not only entertainment, but
also educational support and social interaction, to over 130 million
people world-wide. MLGs currently support their many players
by replicating isolated instances that support each only up to a
few hundred players under favorable conditions. In practice, as
we show here, the real upper limit of supported players can be
much lower. In this work, we posit that performance variability is
a key cause for the lack of scalability in MLGs, investigate experimentally causes of performance variability, and derive actionable
insights. We propose an operational model for MLGs, which extends the state-of-the-art with essential aspects, e.g., through the
consideration of environment-based workloads, which are sizable
workload components that do not depend on player input (once
set in action). Starting from this model, we design the first benchmark that focuses on MLG performance variability, defining specialized workloads, metrics, and processes. We conduct real-world
benchmarking of MLGs, both cloud-based and self-hosted. We find
environment-based workloads and cloud deployment are significant sources of performance variability: peak-latency degrades
sharply to 20.7 times the arithmetic mean, and exceeds by a factor
of 7.4 the performance requirements. We derive actionable insights
for game-developers, game-operators, and other stakeholders to
tame performance variability.
