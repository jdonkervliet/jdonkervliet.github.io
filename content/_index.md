I am a PhD student and teacher at the Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam. I document this adventure on this website.

I do research on the scalability of Minecraft-like games. These games offer players a sandbox where they can let their creativity run free. This allows not only the game’s developer, but also its community, to participate in creating engaging and meaningful content for a world-wide audience.

Next to my research, I teach Computer Networks to first-year Computer Science students at VU and am involved in several other courses in the Computer Science bachelor and masters programs.
