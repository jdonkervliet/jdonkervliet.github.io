I gave an invited talk about the Metaverse and my PhD research to the [Cloud and Distributed Systems Lab](https://cloudlab-urv.github.io/WebCloudlab/) led by [Pedro García López](https://pedrogarcialopez.es/),
who kindly hosted me at the [Universitat Rovira i Virgili](https://www.urv.cat/en/).
The slides of my talk are available here: [pdf](20240907-research-talk-tarragona.pdf).
