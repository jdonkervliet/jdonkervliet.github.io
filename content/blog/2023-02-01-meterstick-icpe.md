I'm proud to announce our work ''Meterstick: Benchmarking Performance Variability in Cloud and Self-hosted Minecraft-like Games'' has been accepted at [ICPE 2023](https://icpe2023.spec.org/)!

The work is led by [Jerrit Eickhoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerrit-eickhoff/), who completed this work over the course of his bachelor's honours and bachelor thesis projects at VU Amsterdam. Well done, Jerrit!

Meterstick abstract:

> Due to increasing popularity and strict performance requirements,
> online games have become a cloud-based and self-hosted work-load of interest for the performance engineering community. One
> of the most popular types of online games is the Minecraft-like
> Game (MLG), in which players can terraform the environment. The
> most popular MLG, Minecraft, provides not only entertainment, but
> also educational support and social interaction, to over 130 million
> people world-wide. MLGs currently support their many players
> by replicating isolated instances that support each only up to a
> few hundred players under favorable conditions. In practice, as
> we show here, the real upper limit of supported players can be
> much lower. In this work, we posit that performance variability is
> a key cause for the lack of scalability in MLGs, investigate experimentally causes of performance variability, and derive actionable
> insights. We propose an operational model for MLGs, which extends the state-of-the-art with essential aspects, e.g., through the
> consideration of environment-based workloads, which are sizable
> workload components that do not depend on player input (once
> set in action). Starting from this model, we design the first benchmark that focuses on MLG performance variability, defining specialized workloads, metrics, and processes. We conduct real-world
> benchmarking of MLGs, both cloud-based and self-hosted. We find
> environment-based workloads and cloud deployment are significant sources of performance variability: peak-latency degrades
> sharply to 20.7 times the arithmetic mean, and exceeds by a factor
> of 7.4 the performance requirements. We derive actionable insights
> for game-developers, game-operators, and other stakeholders to
> tame performance variability.
