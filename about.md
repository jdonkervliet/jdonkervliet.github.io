# Professional

I am both a PhD student and teacher at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

I recently joined the [Knowledge Representation and Reasoning group](https://krr.cs.vu.nl/) as a PhD student. I have previously been part of the [@Large Research group](https://atlarge-research.com/), and am still involved with its [Opencraft](https://atlarge-research.com/opencraft/) project.

I teach the X_40087 Computer Networks course at the Vrije Universiteit.

I use my [twitter feed](http://www.twitter.com/jdonkervliet) to document my life as a PhD student and teacher.

# Education

I obtained both my BSc and MSc degree from the TU Delft. I did my master thesis with the [@Large group](https://atlarge-research.com/), where I worked on increasing the scalability of (modifiable) virtual worlds using _bounded inconsistency_. My work is part of the  [Opencraft project](https://atlarge-research.com/opencraft/), which aims to increase the scalability of Minecraft-like services by at least one order of magnitude.

Next to doing research and taking courses, I have also been actively involved in education at the TU Delft. I have been a teaching assistant for multiple courses in the Computer Science bachelor and master programmes. After graduating I continued working at the TU Delft as a full-time teacher in the Computer Science bachelor (see [Professional](#Professional)).

# Movies

I loved watching movies ever since I saw 'The Lion King' as a little kid. I try to keep track of everything I've seen [here][1].

# Books

If I'm not watching movies I'm probably reading a book. [I also try to keep track of those][2].
